# Problem3-Week2
Consider the Cruise Control Model from the following link https://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=CruiseControl&section=SimulinkModeling 
Build this system in Simulink. Design a controller (P, PI, PD or PID) to achieve following goals with basic building blocks
• Rise time < 5 s
• Overshoot < 10%
• Steady-state error < 2%
Build a reference model to use the PID along with this system. Use Data Dictionary.
